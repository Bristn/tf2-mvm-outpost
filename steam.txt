This is a mvm map set in a snowy and remote outpost. Your task is to help defend Mannco from Greymanns robotic invasion.
This map was made for the Canteen Crasher Contest, but unfortunately it hasnÂ´t made it into the campaign.

Download the files via Google Drive, because the Steam Workshop version only contains the .bsp and .nav files. The [url=https://github.com/Bristn/tf2-mvm-outpost/releases]Github release[/url] additionally contains the .pop files (normal, intermediate, advanced and expert).
